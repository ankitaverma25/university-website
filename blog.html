		<h2>Our Certificates And Online Programs For 2021</h2>
		<p>A blog (a contraction of the term weblog) is a type of website. It is usually maintained by an individual and will have regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order.The personal blog is the most common kind of blog. Personal bloggers spend a lot of time on their blog posts, even if their blog is never read by others. Blogs offer a means to reflect on life or works of art. Few personal blogs gain widespread fame and attention but some personal blogs do manage to win a good following. Some bloggers even land book contracts like the journalist Meenakshi Reddy who wrote the book, “You Are Here”.</p>
		<br>
	   <p>The word “blogging” means maintaining or adding content to a blog. People blog for many reasons. Blogs may provide commentary or news on a particular subject while others are like personal online diaries. In most cases, a blog includes text, images, and links to other blogs, Web pages, and other media related to its topic.Micro blogging seeks to capture a moment in time. Sites, such as Twitter, allow bloggers to share thoughts and feelings instantaneously with friends and family. It is much faster than e-mailing or writing. This form of social media is very popular with an online generation which is too strapped for time to keep in touch.</p>
	   <br>
	   <p> Most blogs have an interactive format to leave comments.Some blogs may focus on art (art log), photographs (photo blog), sketches (sketch blog), videos (v log), music (MP3 blog), and audio (podcasting). Micro blogging is another type of blogging. It features blogs with very short posts.</p>
	   <br>
	   <p>There are corporate blogs as well which are maintained for business purposes. Such blogs are either used internally to enhance the communication and culture in a corporation or externally for marketing, branding or public relations purposes. Question blogging is a kind of blog that answers questions. Questions can be submitted in the form of a submittal form, or through email or other means such as telephone or VOIP.</p>
